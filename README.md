# Switch Operators SDK

Integration guides for operators (fillers) of Switch Limit Orders.

Operators monitor the Switch orderbook for signed limit orders, evaluate
profitability, and fill orders on-chain. Choose the guide for the target
network:

| Network | Chain ID | Native currency | Operator guide |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| PulseChain | `369` | PLS | [PulseChain operator guide](PULSECHAIN.md) |
| Robinhood Chain | `4663` | ETH | [Robinhood operator guide](ROBINHOOD.md) |

Both guides use the same structure and execution model. Their contract
addresses, native currency, routing venues, token data, fee configuration, and
RPC requirements are chain-specific.

## Shared rules

- Include `network=pulsechain` or `network=robinhood` on every orderbook and
  config request.
- Fetch `/limit-orders/config` at startup and support every returned contract
  deployment.
- Fill, simulate, and check nonces against each order's own
  `limitOrderContract`.
- Treat all route and tax information as time-sensitive and simulate the exact
  transaction immediately before broadcast.

## SDK

The network-aware helper package is published as
[`@switch-win/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@switch-win/sdk):

```bash
npm install @switch-win/sdk ethers
```

The current npm release is `1.2.3`. This repository contains the operator
integration documentation; it is not a separate npm package.
